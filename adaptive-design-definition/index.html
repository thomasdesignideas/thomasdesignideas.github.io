<p>The use of adaptive models ranging from technological programs to intelligent systems can be used in the traditional classroom environment. A complex adaptive system is a system that is complex in that it is a dynamic network of interactions but the behavior of the ensemble may not be predictable according to the behavior of the componentsIt is adaptive in that the individual and collective behavior mutate and self-organize corresponding to the change-initiating micro-event or collection of events. Adaptive Policy has three key components. Adaptive radiation explains the reason for biodiversity. They have the same parents and origin grew under the same circumstances and moved to different regions for a better opportunity. Identity classification and propagation.</p>
