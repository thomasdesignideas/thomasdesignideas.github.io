Inserting ink also spelled 入墨 or sometimes 刺青 is the Japanese word for tattoo and is used in English to refer to a distinctive style of Japanese tattooing though it is also used as a blanket term to describe a number of tattoo styles originating in Japan including tattooing traditions from both the Ainu people and the Ryukyuan Kingdom.
