<p>I would suggest this door over a screen door. This is like a garage door except that it is not flush with the ground. A full screwdriver set might seem like it has far more sizes than you will ever need but then there comes a day where you realize that your screwdriver set is missing a size that you desperately need. Open 60 Car Garage to Set an Interior to enabled or Disabled or to customize an interior you can either do it via ini or open your ingame phone and a handy menu will allow you to do it there this mod also has the Ability to Enable MP maps on Game Load Mod Refresh this function can be turned off via ingame menu.

<p>It has 4 adjustable levelling feet to help keep the cabinet level even on uneven floors. A full screwdriver set might seem like it has far more sizes than you will ever need but then there comes a day where you realize that your screwdriver set is missing a size that you desperately need. Allows the door to open to 90 degrees and then slide back into the inside of the cabinet. Due to the dampness I see now not good if you bring cars in during the winter with the snow and nastiness.
