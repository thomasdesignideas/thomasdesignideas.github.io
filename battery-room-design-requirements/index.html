<p>Battcon 2021 will be held November 2-5 at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel in Hollywood FL attracting more than 500 battery professionals for a high-energy mix of industry presentations panel discussions interactive tradeshow and networking opportunities. Battery rooms or stationary storage battery systems SSBS have code requirements such as fire-rated enclosure operation and maintenance safety requirements and ventilation to prevent hydrogen gas concentrations from reaching 4 of the lower explosive level LEL. Make-up air should be introduced at opposite end of the laboratory room from the fume hoods and flow paths for room HVAC systems shall be kept away from hood locations to the extent practical. Our in-house battery and separator application laboratories boast state-of-the-art dry room and pilot-scale assembly operations as well as electrical mechanical and safety.
