<p>The Salesforce Lightning Design System SLDS component library is actively developed to enable Salesforce developers to create a uniform look and feel across all Salesforce-related applications while adhering to CSS best practices and conventions. By removing the impact of varying voltages the necessary calculations are simplified. In order to accomplish this goal weve chosen to use very specific naming techniques. The sooner you onboard stakeholders to the design system the better it is. Everyones support and inputs would make this a system that keeps evolving into a better one.</p>
