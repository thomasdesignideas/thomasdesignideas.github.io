<p>For this I dampen the brush and some paper towels spritz the edges of the top and apply a little bit of paint starting at the edge bringing the brush towards the center. This post started as a very simple recipe for a homemade floor cleanerOver the years Ive experimented and refined it to its current form. Fill the sink with hot water and degreaser drop in the filter and let the degreaser do all the work. Let the primer dry completely which should take anywhere from 2-6 hours so your paint will stick properly. After the touch up paint is dry use a rouge like the Black Magic brand to lightly polish the repair.</p>
