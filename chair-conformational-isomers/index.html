<p><strong>Chair Conformational Isomers</strong>. Conformational isomers exist in a dynamic equilibrium where the relative free energies of isomers determines the population of each isomer and the energy barrier of rotation determines the rate of interconversion between isomers. The activation energy for the chair-chair conversion is due chiefly to a high energy twist-chair form TC in which significant angle and eclipsing strain are present. The chair form and the boat forms are extreme cases.

<p>The compound having same molecular formula but differ in properties are known as isomers and the phenomenon is known as isomerism. If the energy barrier between two conformational isomers is low enough it may be overcome by the random inputs of thermal energy that the molecule gets from interactions with the environment or from its own vibrations.

The activation energy for the chair-chair conversion is due chiefly to a high energy twist-chair form TC in which significant angle and eclipsing strain are present.

<p>Lets first talk about conformationsThese also referred to as conformers or conformational isomers are different arrangements of atoms that occur as a result of rotation about single bondsFor example in the following molecule we can have a different arrangement of atoms by rotating around the middle σ bond.

<p>Conformational isomers or conformers or rotational isomers or rotamers are stereoisomers produced by rotation twisting about σ bonds and are often rapidly interconverting at room temperature. The more stable conformational isomer also called a conformer is the one usually with the least crowding of substituents. UNK the. Conformational isomers exist in a dynamic equilibrium where the relative free energies of isomers determines the population of each isomer and the energy barrier of rotation determines the rate of interconversion between isomers. If the energy barrier between two conformational isomers is low enough it may be overcome by the random inputs of thermal energy that the molecule gets from interactions with the environment or from its own vibrations.</p>
