<p>If you are cleaning a hardwood floor check the degreaser label. A double-sided squeegee is the best tool for cleaning windows. In a spray bottle combine a 14 cup white vinegar with a 12 teaspoon of liquid dish soap. A 50-foot 16-gauge extension cord lets you plug in your vacuum at a central location so you can clean a whole level without stopping to find another outlet. Spray this mixture on the stained portion of your carpet or the entire carpet and vacuum when it dries.</p>

<p>It even works on tablecloths that have been washed and dried. I will say however apple cider vinegar is a great skin cleanser and for people with scaly scalp and dandruff raises hand I swear by it. For that we would recommend using a milder formula. Mix the homemade glass cleaner ingredients and dilute with warm water. Along with that the DIY carpet cleaners just dont remove stains and odors to the same degree of cleaner specifically formulated to do so.</p>
