<p>Had a 15 year old Craftsman 12 HP garage door opener that would open with remote and panel but would not close with the remote. Build quality is superb. If the garage door is the only way in or out or if you cant find the key to the door youll have to either find a way to break in or call a locksmith. If only one of the remote handsets does not work then try replacing batteries and if this does not work then purchase a replacement remote handset. The range includes single 12 HP motor models dual 12 HP motor models as well as 1 HP motor models.</p>
