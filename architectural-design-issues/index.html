Remembering that the lifecycle of the building from inception to deconstruction contributes to the success of the green concept it makes total sense that green architecture relies on both design and construction processes for it to be meaningful. The architecture program is dedicated to the education of future architects who are intellectually aware and who critically understand social political and global conditions that influence our built environment. Architectural Detailing is the go-to text for learning to design details that perform well and look great. Their work was documented in Problem Seeking the text that guided many architects and clients who sought to identify the scope of a design problem prior to beginning the design which is intended to solve the problem.</p>
