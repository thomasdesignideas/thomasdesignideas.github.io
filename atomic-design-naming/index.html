Were not designing pages were designing systems of componentsStephen Hay. There is PEP 8 as other answers show but PEP 8 is only the styleguide for the standard library and its only taken as gospel thereinOne of the most frequent deviations of PEP 8 for other pieces of code is the variable naming specifically for methods. At code reviews we can focus on important design decisions or program flow rather than argue about naming.</p>
