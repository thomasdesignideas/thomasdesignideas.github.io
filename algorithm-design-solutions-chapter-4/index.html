<p>243 Solutions for the Maximum Subsequence Sum Problem 60. Algorithms and flowcharts are different mechanisms used for designing different programs particularly in computer programming. For example if we have an algorithm which makes 50n steps and another one which makes 1100nn steps for elements up to 5000 the quadratic algorithm will be faster than the linear. This section discusses more advanced concepts which you may prefer to skip on the first time through this chapter. The algorithm exists in many variants.</p>
